This is a code package related to the following paper:

Y. Mao, B. Clerckx and V. O. K. Li, "Rate-splitting multiple access for downlink communication systems: bridging, generalizing, and outperforming SDMA and NOMA." EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking 2018.1 (2018): 133.

The code in all packages are implemented in Matlab environment with CVX toolbox assisted. 

In the 'Figure 6b' code package,  Fig. 6(b) of the above paper will be reproduced by running the Matlab script 'main.m'. By changing the variables 'bias' (channel gain difference between the users), 'NT'(number of transmit antenna), you can reproduce Fig. 5--Fig. 6.

In the 'Figure 7' code package,  Fig. 7 of the above paper will be reproduced by running the Matlab script 'main.m'. By changing the variable 'bias' and the channel realizations, you can reproduce Fig. 7--Fig. 10.

In the 'Figure 11' code package,  Fig. 11 of the above paper will be reproduced by running the Matlab script 'main.m'. By changing the variable 'bias' and the channel realizations, you can reproduce Fig. 11--Fig. 12.

In the 'Figure 13' code package, Fig. 13 of the above paper will be reproduced by running the Matlab script 'main.m'. By changing the variable 'weight' and 'NT', you can reproduce Fig. 13, Fig. 14, Fig. 16.
